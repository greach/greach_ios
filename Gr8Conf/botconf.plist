			<string>A Groovy journey in Open Source land</string>
			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string><![CDATA[In dog years... err... Open Source years, the Groovy programming language project is a very mature and successful one, as its 4.5 million downloads a year can attest. The Groovy language is certainly the most widely deployed alternative language of the JVM today. But how do we go from a hobby night &amp; week-end project to professionally company sponsored? And back again to hobby mode but joining the wider Apache Software Foundation community?Guillaume will guide you through the history of the project, its latest developments, and its recent news, outlining the importance of a community around an Open Source project. Also, we'll discuss what it means to contribute, when it's your hobby or as a paid committer -- what does it change? What it means to join the Apache community, what the impact of professional Open Source is, and more.]]></string>

			<string>A Test Driven Approach to Documenting RESTful APIs with Spring REST Docs</string>
			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string>Documentation generated from source code is very popular. Solutions such as Swagger are available for many different languages and frameworks. However, limitations of annotation based tools are becoming apparent. An overwhelming number of documentation annotations make for great docs but muddy the source code. Then, something changes and the docs are out of date again.That is where test-driven approaches come in.Test-driven documentation solutions, such as Spring Rest Docs, generate example snippets for requests and responses from tests ensuring both code coverage and accurate documentation. It can even fail the build when documentation becomes out of date. This session will walk through how to implement test-driven documentation solutions for groovy ecosystem technologies like Spring Boot and Grails. Attendees should have a basic understanding of AsciiDoc and how to construct RESTful APIs in Spring Boot and/or Grails.</string>

			<string>The Amazon Echo is more than a home toy - you can have the real star trek experience in your home with hooks into home automation platforms, streaming music, news, help you cook, tell you jokes, etc. Now let's Groovy all the things and make a Grails app that can host new Alexa skills! I will go over how to make them in two ways, via Grails 3 and web services and also via AWS Lamba. You can use Groovy for both of these approaches! I will bring one to demonstrate some fun things you can do with it. I'm sure if you don't already have one you'll be hacking away as soon as you get home.</string>

			<string>Building reactive applications with the Grails 3 event system</string>
			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string>Grails 3 introduced a brand new event system which is based on Reactor. This new feature allows developers building reactive applications with Grails 3. In this talks we will cover the event system in Grails 3 in detail and explain how it can be used for asynchronous and decoupled communication between commands, services and even plugins. In addition to that I will also explain the characteristics of reactive applications and show in how far the Grails 3 event system will support you in developing such applications</string>

			<string>Codenarc Revisited</string>
			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string>When was the last time you looked at code quality? Do you have some old codenarc configuration with half(or more!) of the rules turned off because they were reporting false positives? Or maybe you have @SupressWarnings all over your code? Or perhaps you want to do something small like to enforce tabs vs spaces for all members of your team?Codenarc is a static analysis tool for Groovy that enforces style, detects bad practices, and suggests improvements. If it has been awhile since you last looked at codenarc, there might be new rules or configuration options to get you back on the path to better code quality. This session will explore what is new with codenarc, options for specific groovy ecosystem projects such as grails, and walk through how to create custom rules for your own project.</string>

			<string>Creating and testing REST contracts with Accurest Gradle Plugin</string>
			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string>REST does not come with an in-built contract compliance mechanism, which in many ways is a great thing. However, while working with microservice-based systems, it often appears that a practical mechanism that would provide help in shaping and describing REST contracts would come in handy. Similarly, creating integration and acceptance tests in such systems presents many challenges. In this talk, I will present Accurest, a Gradle plugin that allows for both: easily shaping REST contracts and verifying if our app adheres to them using automatically generated Spock tests. I will show how, using Accurest, we can quickly generate automatically-tested stubs from simple Groovy DSL scripts. I will talk about the typical usages and script examples, as well as possible problems and ways of handling them.</string>

			<string>Dockerize your Grails App for more deployment fun</string>
			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string>Do you know the pain of maintaining different Versions of Grails, Redis, PhantomJS or Postgres on your development box to work with various projects you’re involved in over time? Even if you get it done, how is this repeatable if a new colleague starts at your company? How do you set up testing environments for QA with different versions of your apps? Docker can be the answer to this. In this talk i will introduce Docker and tell you why it’s worth looking at from a developer's perspective. Starting with different introductory examples, we will dockerize a “real world” Grails app with dependent services. Additionally we’ll have a look at the differences Grails 3 brings to the table regards containerization. You will learn that managing the mentioned problems and more becomes a breeze and can even be a lot of fun.</string>

			<string>Feeling Groovy: Experiences as a Groovy Developer in the Java World</string>
			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string>Despite the name, Groovy has never been the "hipster" language. It's greatest advantage -- almost trivial integration with Java -- keeps it from being perceived as exciting and new. Existing Java developers often overlook it when they get frustrated with Java. A small effort by Groovy advocates can change that, however. This talk will demonstrate ways to show hesitant Java developers how much easier their lives can be when adding Groovy to their projects.</string>

			<string>When it comes to Grails, one of it’s biggest strength is its plugin repository. However, with 3.x, most of the plugins have become unusable(no backward compatibility). This is where we, the Grails community need to play a solid role and contribute.In this session we would be taking a plugin and migrating it from 2.x to 3.x to show how easy it is to contribute to the community. We’ll also go through some of the common problems that usually crop up and how to move past them.Why contributing to community is important? Migrating a plugin - Live Walkthrough Potential challenges while migrating plugins 3rd party plugins dependencies. Gant Scripts Interceptors Alternatives for depreciated tags. Alternatives for methods/classes which have been removed. Migrating test cases. Publishing Grails Plugin on Bintray.</string>

			<string>Maven has been the dominant build tool in the Java space for quite some time now. While it's a proven technology it's certainly aged, there are new and better alternatives out there. Gradle is perhaps the one that's better positioned to succeed Maven as the build tool of choice. Since 2012 Gradle adoption has skyrocketed. Not only do popular and big open source projects, such as Spring and its portfolio, Hibernarte and Groovy, have migrated to Gradle but large enterprises too. Not to forget that Gradle is the defacto build tool for Android applications since 2013.In this workshop we'll learn the basics of Gradle scripts; writing custom tasks, creating plugins, and more.</string>

			<string>Groovy Parallel Patterns: A Library to Support Parallelization</string>
			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string>Much has been written concerning the use of Parallel Design Patterns and Skeletal Frameworks but few, if any, have then converted the ideas contained into software products that can be used in the deployment of such parallel systems. The Patterns and Skeletons so far proposed still require the programmer to have a great deal of understanding of parallel systems design. The Communicating Process Architecture community has been producing reusable plug and play components that can be used to build parallel systems based upon Hoare’s Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) theory for more than 30 years using various languages. These ideas are now integrated into the Library described in this paper. The ptresntation will give an overview of the library using Monte Carlo pi and Concnordance aas primary examples together with a more challenging examples using Primes and the Goldbach Conjecture and the Mandelbrot set</string>

			<string>Hackergarten is a craftmen's workshop, classroom, a laboratory, a social circle, a playground, and an artist's studio. Our goal is to create something that others can use; whether it be working software, improved documentation, or better educational materials. Our intent is end the evening with a patch or similar contribution submitted to an open and public project. Everyone can join, you do not have to attend GR8Conf! What to Expect - You'll meet some gr8 people, write some gr8 code, and contribute directly to the Groovy community. Expect to leave Hackergarten knowing a Groovy framework or project a lot better, knowing how to create and submit a patch to an open source project, and meeting some new friends. There is no better way to learn about the GR8 technologies than to spend a few hours coding side by side with the project leaders and members What to Bring: Yourself, perhaps your laptop. Expect to pair program. If you don't have a laptop then someone else will.</string>

			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string><![CDATA[I bet that Spock needs not to be introduced to anyone here. For many of us it was an entry point to the thrilling world of Groovy. Spock has a flat learning curve - a sensible Java programmer (without prior Groovy experience) can start writing Spock specifications within several minutes. However, when you combine Groovy &amp; Spock magic, a new fascinating meta-world is created. The exploration of its every nook and cranny can take much longer (and it's definitely much more efficient with a guide ;-).You can expect a set of more advanced (and/or less known) techniques and mechanisms, the use of which can even more simplify and facilitate the testing of our code. You have to be forewarned that we will also visit those dark areas where it is better not to enter, things that do not work or work in a way nobody expects.Spoiler. It will a Groovy focused version of my warmly welcomed "Smarter testing Java code with Spock Framework" presentation, enriched with additional tricks and traps.]]></string>

			<string>Introduction to Graphics- and UI-Design</string>
			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string>Many developers forgo design, ergonomics and userexperience because they lack the knowledge and an eye for the creation of nice, userfriendly UI's, components, icons, webpages and presentations.Very often, they work together with visual artist and customers that think in images. But often theese lack the view to restrictions and needs of developers. To cross this gap, you should be able to 'talk their language' - design bases on psychology and targets, but embraces manipulation aswell. This session will not enchant you to a pixel guru, but tries to enlighten the world of designers. As soon as colors, typography and the mystical beeing called 'user' get clearer, UI can get much better.</string>

In this session, we will discuss the specifics of the "Java Software Model", and how it will help you to describe what is your application, rather than how to build it: declaring libraries, declaring test suites, target platforms, ... We will show the advantages in terms of performance, dependency management and expressiveness, and hint at how you can extend the model with your own plugins. The future of Gradle is here!</string>

			<string>Metaprogramming with Groovy</string>
			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string>Groovy is a dynamic language that provides different types of metaprogramming techniques. In this talk we’ll mainly see runtime metaprogramming. You’ll understand the Groovy Meta-Object-Protocol (MOP), the metaclass, how to intercept method calls, how to deal with method missing and property missing, the use of mixins, traits and categories. All of these topics will be explained with examples in order to understand them.Also, you’ll see a little bit about compile-time metaprogramming with AST Transformations. AST Transformations provide a wonderful way of manipulating code at compile time via modifications of the Abstract Syntax Tree. You’ll see a basic but powerful example of what we can do with AST transformations.</string>

			<string>We at TO THE NEW Digital had to build a live streaming application for our client #fame. The challenges were immense. It was the GR8 eco-system that came to our rescue. In this session I will share my experience of using GR8 technologies like Groovy, Grails, Boot, etc for building this live streaming application. I will talk about how these set of tools and technologies helped us in doing some quick PoCs, coming up with quick working models and growing them into the whole system. We will take a look at the architecture of the application, and how we are moving forward in creating a scalable system while having a solid foundation of these Gr8 techonolgies</string>

			<string>Variant aware dependency management with Gradle</string>
			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string>Gradle now comes with a new Java software model which supports advanced dependency resolution. Did you ever think that you missed the "provided scope" of Maven? What if we told you that there are very few chances that the dependencies you need for Wildfly are the same set of dependencies as for Apache Tomcat? Likewise, it is probable that the JDK 9 version of your application doesn't require the same dependency set as the JDK 7 one.In addition to solving this, Gradle will let you define your own variant dimensions: do you have a free and a paid flavor? Do you want a release and debug version? No problem! We'll show you how to create your own component types that define their own variant types, and how the dependency resolution engine will let you create the combinations and resolve the dependencies in an appropriate way. Futhermore, we will show how fast Gradle can be in solving this, without involving a penalty in configuration time or verbosity in the script.</string>

Since then he has lectured at Sheffield City Polytechnic, Sheffield University and most recently at Edinburgh Napier University. He is a Fellow of the British Computer Society and a Chartered Engineer. He built his first concurrent system, using Concurrent Pascal, in 1976 and has retained an interest in such systems ever since. He was an early user of the Inmos Transputer and its programming language occam. While at Sheffield University he became Director of the National Transputer Support Centre. One of his main achievements during this period was to build a parallel database machine, using more than 200 Transputers, that was capable of undertaking both SQL queries and on-line transaction processing in parallel on the same data at the same time. Since the mid-1980’s he has taught concurrent and parallel programming techniques to both post- and under-graduate students. As he moved between education institutions he always had to introduce the teaching of this subject. In particular, the teaching of Concurrent and Parallel Programming to students who have never seen the concepts before or who have been shown old-fashioned and outdated mechanisms.
